# 🏠 House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project is a hands-on practice notebook from my Udacity training where I explored the fundamentals of linear regression using a house pricing dataset.

### ✅ What I Did:
- Explored and cleaned the dataset
- Built a baseline Dummy Regressor
- Trained a Simple Linear Regression model using just the `size` feature
- Trained a Multiple Linear Regression model using all features: `beds`, `baths`, `size`, `lot_size`
- Evaluated each model using R² and RMSE

### 🛠️ Tools Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### 💡 Key Takeaway:
Even simple models can provide real insights! `size` alone explained 18% of the price variation. Adding all features only slightly improved performance, which was a great learning moment.
